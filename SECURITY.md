# Security Policy

## Alpha Stage Warning

⚠️ IntentKit is currently in alpha stage. While we take security seriously, the software may contain unknown vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk and not recommended for production environments without thorough security review.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of IntentKit seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@crestal.network](mailto:security@crestal.network) with the following information:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Credentials

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management
   - Follow the example in `example.env`

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper authentication for your deployment
   - Use secure session management
   - Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

3. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
   - Use firewalls to restrict access
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

### Agent Security

1. **Quota Management**
   - Always implement rate limiting
   - Monitor agent usage patterns
   - Set appropriate quotas for your use case

2. **Tool Access**
   - Carefully review tool permissions
   - Implement tool-specific rate limiting
   - Monitor tool usage and audit logs

3. **Autonomous Execution**
   - Review autonomous prompts carefully
   - Implement safeguards for autonomous actions
   - Monitor autonomous agent behavior

### Database Security

1. **Connection Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL for database connections
   - Restrict database access to necessary operations

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement proper backup procedures
   - Regular security audits

### Deployment Security

1. **Container Security**
   - Keep base images updated
   - Run containers as non-root
   - Scan containers for vulnerabilities

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Use secure infrastructure configurations
   - Implement logging and monitoring
   - Regular security updates

## Known Limitations

1. **Alpha Stage Limitations**
   - Security features may be incomplete
   - APIs may change without notice
   - Some security controls are still in development

2. **Integration Security**
   - Third-party integrations may have their own security considerations
   - Review security implications of enabled integrations
   - Monitor integration access patterns

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Updates will be published:

1. As GitHub releases with security notes
2. Via security advisories for critical issues
3. Through our notification system for registered users

## Secure Development

When contributing to IntentKit, please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Code Review**
   - All code must be reviewed before merging
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional review
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories for dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests where applicable
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate input and output handling

## Version Support

Given the alpha stage of the project, we currently:
- Support only the latest release
- Provide security updates for critical vulnerabilities
- Recommend frequent updates to the latest version

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following for their contributions to our security:

- All security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities
- Our community members who help improve our security
- Contributors who help implement security features
