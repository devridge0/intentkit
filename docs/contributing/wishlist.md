# Wishlist for IntentKit

## Where to Start

The overall wishlist of contribution requests can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/2).

We have divided the request types into five distinct categories, each with its own separate wishlist for easier browsing.

To get started, either speak with the team in pre-arranged groups or directly tag `@hyacinthus` or `@taiyangc` on the issues you are interested in contributing to.

## Wishlist Categories

### On-chain wallet actions

[Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/3)

This category covers everything related to on-chain wallet interactions. It includes adding extra functionalities to any wallet provider or even integrating an entirely new wallet provider. It also encompasses support for assets beyond the basic, well-known ones. Multi-chain support is currently under development—so if you would like to support any protocol on chains other than Base, please consult the core contributors first.

Any Web3 protocol that involves interactions with an on-chain wallet falls under this category. More protocol integrations mean greater customization of agents, offering endless variety for both creators and end users.

### Data fetching

[Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/4)

This category involves integrating with any data sources or data-fetching APIs. This can include both web2 and web3 APIs—essentially, anything that provides data source or data infrastructure support for agents. Data fetching can usually be accomplished through a few API calls; however, integrating with premium sources can be critical for many advanced agents.

### Data generation

[Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/5)

This category encompasses all data generation capabilities. This may involve multimedia generation, export, input, or even data manipulation for agents or end users. Data generation is a critical component of most businesses and user needs. The possibilities are limitless, and integration can occur at either the LLM level or the skill level.

### Intelligence

[Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/6)

This category involves supporting new LLMs and LLM infrastructures. Anything that enhances the intelligence of the agents qualifies here. More intelligence integrations mean more ways for agents to be helpful, efficient, and cost-effective.

### Entrypoints

[Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/crestalnetwork/projects/1/views/7)

This category is somewhat analogous to supporting communication channels in traditional app development. Facilitating interactions with agents or enabling agents to interact through these channels is critical for reaching audiences beyond typical web3 social channels. More channels mean more distribution methods and a broader reach to end users.

## Non-applicable?

If what you are trying to build does not fall under any of the categories above, feel free to create an issue and clearly describe what you are building.

If it indeed falls under a completely new category we have overlooked, we will gladly consider it and add it to the overall list.
